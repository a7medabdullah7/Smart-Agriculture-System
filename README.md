## 📌 Project Overview

Smart Agriculture System helps farmers monitor crops automatically and detect diseases instantly through a live camera feed.

Once a disease is detected:

✅ The disease name appears on the dashboard  
✅ Confidence score is calculated  
✅ Detection logs are saved automatically  
✅ Robot receives command to move toward target area  
✅ Full monitoring can be accessed remotely through browser
